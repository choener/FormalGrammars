-- | The basic data types for formal languages up to and including context-free
-- grammars.
--
-- TODO we shall have to extend the system for multi-tape grammars to allow
-- combined terminal/non-terminal systems. This will basically mean dealing
-- with context-sensitive grammars, at which we can just fully generalize
-- everything.
--
-- TODO we need a general system to generate fresh variable names of varying
-- dimension. This is very much desired for certain operations (especially on
-- products).
--
-- BIGTODO @E _@ are actually the "None" thing in ADPfusion; while normal
-- epsilons are just terminals.
